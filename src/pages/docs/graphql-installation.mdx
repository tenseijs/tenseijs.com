description: How to install and start using the Tensei graphql plugin 
---

## Installation
Tensei has first class support for GraphQL. To get a fully featured and highly customisable GraphQL API, you need to install the `@tensei/graphql` package. It is shipped externally alongside the `@tensei/rest` package.

If you generated a Tensei project using `create-tensei-app`, this plugin might already be installed and ready to go in your application. Otherwise, you can install it using the following command:

```shell
yarn add @tensei/graphql

# Or using npm
npm install --save @tensei/graphql
```

## Register GraphQL Plugin

Once installed, require the plugin and add it to the `.plugins([])` array on the tensei instance:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .resources([...])
    .plugins([
        graphql().plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```

That's all you need. Configure some resources for your application, and start the node server. By default, the API should be available at `/graphql`. 

## Apollo Server Options
Behind the scenes, Tensei creates a new apollo server instance to serve your GraphQL API. You may pass additional configuration options to the Apollo server using the `.configure()` method on th
e graphql plugin:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        graphql()
            .configure({
                playground: false
            })
            .plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```

## Middleware options
By default, Apollo server express ships with some default express middleware such as cors and bodyparser. You may customize the options passed to Apollo to configure the express middleware using the `.middlewareOptions()` method:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        graphql()
            .middlewareOptions({
                path: '/api',
                disableHealthCheck: true
            })
            .plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```

## Enable subscriptions
By default, subscriptions are not enabled. You may call the `.subscriptions()` method to enable subscriptions.

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        graphql()
            .subscriptions()
            .plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```

In development, Apollo Server will use the default in-memory PubSub, and it is intended for demo purposes only. For production usage, you may pass a custom PubSub instance to the `.subscriptions()` method:

```js
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')
const { graphql } = require('@tensei/graphql')
const { RedisPubSub } = require('graphql-redis-subscriptions')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        graphql()
            .subscriptions(new RedisPubSub())
            .plugin()
    ])
    .start()
```
