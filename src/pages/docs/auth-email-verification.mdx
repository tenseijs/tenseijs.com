description: How to handle email verification with Tensei auth
---

You may need to verify emails in your application. To enable this functionality, you may call the `.verifyEmails()` method on the auth plugin instance:

```js
const { auth } = require('@tensei/auth')
const { tensei } = require('@tensei/core')

tensei()
    .plugins([
        auth()
            .verifyEmails()
            .plugin()
    ])
```

Enabling this feature will add two new fields to the user resource:
- `Email Verification Token`, a text field to store a unique token sent to the user's email for confirmation
- `Email Verified At`, a nullable datetime field that saves when a user's email was verified. You may check if this field is null to know if the user's account is verified or not.

## Verify emails
Enabling this feature adds a new mutation to the GraphQL API and a new route to the Rest API.

```graphql
input confirm_user_email_input {
  email_verification_token: String!
}

extend Mutation {
  confirm_user_email(object: confirm_user_email_input!): user!
  resend_user_verification_email: Boolean
}
```

A new route `POST auth/emails/verification/confirm` is also added. This endpoint requires passing the `email_verification_token` from the user's email in the request body.

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const instance = Axios.create({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4500'
})

instance.post('auth/emails/verification/confirm', {
    email_verification_token: 'whcnzm8h34xdq828car7vvgsm96n9dbe6etgbkvs'
}).then(console.log)
```

## Resend verification email
You may want to add a `Resend Verification email` button on your client-side application. This plugin provides a GraphQL mutation for resending the confirmation email. The user must be authenticated to make this request.

Here's an example with graphql-request:

```js
import { GraphqlClient } from 'graphql-request'

const RESEND_VERIFICATION_EMAIL = gql`
    mutation resend_user_verification_email {
        resend_user_verification_email
    }
`

const client = new GraphqlClient('http://localhost:4500')

client.request(RESEND_VERIFICATION_EMAIL).then(console.log)
```

You may also use the REST api endpoint `POST auth/emails/verification/resend` to resend a confirmation email to the user. No payload is needed for this endpoint.
